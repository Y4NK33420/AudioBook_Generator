# Voice Samples

This directory contains voice samples for the XTTS voice cloning system.

## Guidelines
- Use WAV format with 22050+ Hz sampling rate
- Samples should be clear without background noise
- As little as 5 seconds of audio is sufficient for voice cloning
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `male_narrator.wav`, `female_storyteller.wav`)
